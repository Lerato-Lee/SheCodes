# SheCodes is a social networking platform for techies from all around the globe to come together and share their views and work together to build cool new tech projects that can change the world we live in. SheCodes is all about diversity.
Sometimes being too serious can be a bit boring, users can share funny tech memes to make one laugh or smile if they're having a bad day, a place where techies especially women empower and motivate, help one another in this tech journey by sharing job posts, learning materials for students and so much more.

 # SheCodes (A social platform website)
Technology Rules, Society Follows! 🧑‍💻

# 2. Team members:
Lerato Mthimkhulu.
I will be handling all aspects of this project

# 3. Technologies
Coding languages used include:  HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This project will be deployed on CloudFlare

-I used JavaScript to create drop down menus, to animate images and also add them,  and pretty much all the functionality of this website.
-I then used HTML to structure the web page and all it’s content
-CSS to make UI/UX look more presentable and aesthetically pleasing to the user's eye.

# 4. Challenge Statement
There are days where I feel demotivated and feel lost. I look into social media and how stereotypical people often make tech to be and that adds to me getting even more demotivated and feel like I don’t belong. I’ve always thought tech was for mem and seeing women evolving and getting into tech really inspired me to become one too. Hard as it is I feel that If  created a platform where we can all empower each other and help each other out, we won’t feel alone and demotivated like how I felt when I started the tech journey. The move towards increasing inclusivity and diversity in the industry through representation is of importance to me.

It is NOT  a social media platform like facebook. It is designed for women in technology whether you're a cybersecurity analyst, software engineer, Software tester or software engineer to come together and empower one another. Users can be male and female, male that will also help encourage women to get into tech and which doors to knock on etc. This platform can  be used internationally, it is not for a specific location. Everyone in the world can connect and share their views.

# 5. Risks

# Tech Risks:
Unmonitored accounts - I can monitor social media accounts to ensure that they have not been compromised by using namely Loomly Interactions to help manage comments, mentions and messages.
Phishing attacks and scams-  Basic security awareness training to prohibit any of these attacks. This will enable me to recognize phishing messages and caution users not to open and download them (with the help of Loomly links).
Data privacy  and protection-  Making sure my brand complies with location-specific data privacy and protection laws.

Imposter accounts-  I can avoid this by getting users verified to recognize the brand’s genuine account.


# Non-Tech Risks:
Processes- Without the right operational processes in place, there’s a risk that wrong people get access to social media accounts, or the wrong content gets published at the wrong time.
Reputation- As social media content is published on platforms outside of an organization, there’s an immediate risk that a brand’s reputation can be damaged. Whether it’s a human error, an oversight, or a security hack, it can have a negative impact on the brand and lead to a loss in confidence of customers Social media workflows need to be as robust as possible to prevent any mishaps.

# 6. Infrastructure
For web hosting, I will be using CloudFlare, a safe and reliable  way  to host websites on the internet for FREE.
      Link >> https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb
I will  run the app myself and start to use it to detect any bugs, posting to feed, messaging and writing blogs, commenting, saving the context, then exit the app. After that I will copy the created sqlite database file and add resources to my site. 
For testing I can use TestRail which is a great tool for both manual and automatic testing.
I will  also test using processes such as Functionality testing, Usability testing, interface testing, Compatibility testing, Performance testing, and security testing.

# 7. Existing Solutions
Women in Tech® - Global Movement -  The difference is that SheCodes is more of a social network platform specifically for women in tech, whereas, Women in tech is a website.
Women in tech is a great idea, I implemented a change so that all users are able to connect and share their views as well.
